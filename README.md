- It serves as a case study for understanding the development of a desktop application in an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) fashion.
- The project provides a well-written code base, surpassing the typical size of beginner-level SE modules (around 6 KLoC) without becoming overwhelming.
- Extensive user and developer documentation is included to facilitate understanding and usage.
