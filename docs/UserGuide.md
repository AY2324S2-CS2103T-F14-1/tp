## Features

<box type="info">

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add c/COMPANY_NAME`, `COMPANY_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add c/Food Panda`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `c/COMPANY_NAME [a/ADDRESS]` can be used as `c/Food Panda a/CBD` or as `c/Food Panda`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `add c/COMPANY_NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER add c/COMPANY_NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed contact list.
2. Next, include only specific prefix for the fields of the contact you wish to edit in your records. 
At least one of the optional fields must be provided and at most one of each field can be provided.

</box>
  
<box type="tip">

For `[NOTE]`, please refer to the "Adding a note" section below for more details.
For `[INTERVIEW_DATE]`, if you want to remove a date, just enter `d/` and it will remove that field.

</box>

**Example:**
In this scenario, we've received confirmation of an interview details from a previously unresponsive company, A STAR. 

![edit command](images/UserGuide/beforeEditCommand.png)

To update the status tag from "NR" to "I," please utilize the following command:

`edit 5 t/I`.

Additionally, to include the interview date on 14th of April 2024 at 3pm, use:

`edit 5 d/14-04-2024 1500`.

When both commands are executed together, it will appear as follows: 

`edit 5 t/I d/14-04-2024 1500`. 

This not only alters the tag to "Interview" but also specifies the interview schedule as indicated:
![edit command](images/UserGuide/afterEditCommand.png)

### Locating contacts by name: `find`

<box>

**Format:** `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

</box>

* All matching results of the find will be displayed in your view panel

* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Food Panda` will match `Panda Food`
* Only the name is searched.

* Contacts matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Happy Burger` will return `Happy Meal`, `Burger Queen`

Examples:

  ![result for 'find burger'](images/find/findBurgerResult.png)


### Adding a Note : `note`

This command will allow you to add & edit notes to an internship application contact. There are 2 ways to execute this command based on your use<br>

<box>

**Format:** `note INDEX`

</box>

1. Adding a note when **creating a new company contact**
    - Simply include the note you want in the **add** command using the syntax `n/[NOTE]`
    - `add c/FoodPanda ...other attributes... n/This is a note`

2. Updating a note of an **existing company contact**
    - Suppose you want to edit the note of company contact at index **2**
    - Use the note command as follows : `note 2`
      ![enter note 2](images/note-feature/note_1.png)
    - When you hit enter, it will retrieve the note content of the company contact at index 2 in the command box **as an edit command** :
      ![command executes](images/note-feature/note_2.png)
    - Simply update the note content and hit enter again :
      ![command executes](images/note-feature/note_3.png)
    - The next time you view the contact, the note section will be updated :
      ![command executes](images/note-feature/note_4.png)


<box type="tip">

To clear a note, simply use `edit INDEX n/`

</box>


<box type="warning">

**Caution:**
If you use `edit INDEX n/your updates for the new note`, this **WILL OVERWRITE** the old note of the company contact at `INDEX`<br>
For these kinds of scenarios, make use of the `note INDEX` function !

</box>

### Filtering the data (by tags) : `filter`

Filtering data allows you to narrow down your search results to focus on internship contacts based on their status. 
Use the `filter` command to filter by tag and find exactly the internships that have an interview.

<box>

**Format:** `filter [VALID TAG]`

</box>

<box type="info">

Valid Tag Inputs   
- NR: No Reply
- I: Interview
- O: Offered
- OA: Online Assessment
- R: Rejected

</box>

Examples:
- `filter I`
- Filters the list of contacts to only have internship company contacts that have an Interview status
![resultFilter](images/filter/filterIResult.png)

### Sending reminders : `reminder`

Sending reminders is a pivotal practice to uphold organization and ensure timely completion of crucial tasks. 
Although our application presently lacks a built-in reminder feature, fear not! 
You can effortlessly retrieve reminders manually using this command. 
It conveniently displays the interviews scheduled within the upcoming N days, 
keeping you well-prepared and on track.

<box>

**Format:** `reminder INT`

</box>

- `reminder 2` : Shows you the interviews you have in the next two days, including today.
- `reminder 20` : Shows you the interviews you have in the next twenty days, including today.

![reminder command](images/UserGuide/reminderCommand.png)

## Storage & Data

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning">

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

</box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous InternHub home folder.

**Q**: What is a home folder?<br>
**A**: The home folder is the main directory associated with a user account on a computer. It typically contains user-specific settings, documents, downloads, and other personal files.

**Q**: Does the user know how to open the command terminal/how to change directory (cd) into a folder?<br>
**A**: Users should refer to the documentation or help resources specific to their operating system for instructions on opening a command terminal and navigating to a directory using the `cd` command.

**Q**: How do I run internhub.jar?<br>
**A**: You can run internhub.jar by opening a command terminal, navigating to the directory containing the jar file using the `cd` command, and then typing `java -jar internhub.jar` and pressing Enter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
