#### Feature Enhancements

</box>

##### Note Feature

**Issue** : User unable to modify or update _existing_ note content of a contact without **overwriting** the data

**Proposed Solution** : Based on the index, user can retrieve & make updates to the note content of a contact in the command box

**Implementation** : Integrate `NoteCommand` with Model layer & UI component to fetch & update note content

**Challenges**
- Implementing a command that communicates with the UI was intricate
- Parsing the `CommandResult` to uniquely identify that it is that of a `NoteCommand`

**Benefits**
- Allows users to efficiently manage and update note content for contacts
- Enhance user experience by providing a convenient method to interact with the notes field through the command line

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Base UI of Company Card

**Issue** : Default UI of a company card does not allow for various fields of a contact to be displayed in a user-friendly manner

**Proposed Solution** : Redesign the layout of the UI for company card to visually organize the data of the contact

**Implementation** : JavaFX file implemented to update the UI independently of other components

**Challenges**
- Getting accustomed to the JavaFX methods to replicate the desired model design
- Integrating a neat design while still maintaining integration of dynamic data
- Analysing for which fields would Label or TextArea be more appropriate

**Benefits**
- Allows users to have a centralised overview of all the data pertaining to a contact
- Visually striking elements like _interview date_ emphasises key details of that contact
